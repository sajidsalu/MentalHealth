    description: `As a form of low-impact exercise, yoga has been shown to lower stress hormones in our bodies while simultaneously increasing beneficial brain chemicals like endorphins and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). These feel-good chemicals help decrease anxiety and improve mood.

    Over time, yoga's effects also are believed to slow the natural aging process — there is less brain shrinkage in the areas of the brain that process information and store memories, Dr. Keenmon says. "Making yoga a part of our lives can help protect against the effects of aging on our memory and cognition."`,

    description: ` Exercise helps prevent and improve a number of health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis. Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can also help improve mood and reduce anxiety.
    The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear — but working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better.`,

Try to get protein from plant sources and fish and choose healthy fats, such as olive oil or canola, rather than saturated fats.',

    Your mindset works as a foundation for your experiences in this world. The same events can happen to different people, and everyone will react differently – based on the mindset they hold.`,
